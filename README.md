# Baseball Trip Planner (Solo Project)

This project was originally a team assignment for **CS1D: Data Structures**.  
I have taken full ownership and continued development as a solo project.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The program simulates a **baseball road trip planner**, allowing users to:
- Plan custom trips across MLB stadiums
- Calculate optimized travel routes
- View team and stadium information
- Track and purchase souvenirs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++ (Qt Framework)**
- **CMake** for build automation
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, DFS
- **CSV files** for data management

## 🚀 How to Build & Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirshayanHamidin/baseball_solo.git
